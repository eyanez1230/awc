        <p>Special Notice to California Residents. If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>We will not share any personal information about you to the extent prohibited by applicable California
              law or to the extent your prior consent to share is required by applicable California law; and</p>

                products or services marketed.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The rights of users</p>
        <p>We adopt this Notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). Any terms defined in
          the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice.</p>
        <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
        <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously
            given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
          <li>Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the
            processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are provided in the dedicated
            section below.</li>
          <li>Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain
            disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.
          </li>
          <li>Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to
            be updated or corrected.</li>
          <li>Restrict the processing of their Data. Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right, under
            certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process
            their Data for any purpose other than storing it.</li>
          <li>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed. Users have the right, under certain circumstances,
            to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.
          </li>
          <li>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller. Users have the right to receive their
            Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
            transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that the Data
            is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on the User's consent, on a contract which
            the User is part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
          <li>Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Details about the right to object to processing</p>

        <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in
          the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
        <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they
          can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the Owner is
          processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this
          document.</p>
        <p>How to exercise these rights</p>
        <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in
          this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as
          possible and always within one month.</p>
        <p>We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you. The designated email
          address for these requests is support@ylopo.com</p>
